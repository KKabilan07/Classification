# In Matlab and Weka
Classification using datasets collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository
namely:
1.Soybean(Small)
2.Wine Quality(Red)

Regression using datasets collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository
namely:
1.Binke Sharing
2.Wine Quality(White)
3.Auto MPG

I will include the csv(to upload in matlab) and arff(to upload in weka).
MATLAB is a programming and numeric computing platform used by millions of engineers and scientists to analyze data, develop algorithms, and create models.
Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for solving real-world data mining problems.
